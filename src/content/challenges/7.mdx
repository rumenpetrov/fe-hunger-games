  ## Requirements
  * Develop responsive grid with media cards using [the display grid property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout)
    * One column on mobile screens
    * Four columns on desktop screens (>= 1280px)
  * All cards in one row should have the same total height
  * Every card should have a preview area and **optional** content (text) area
    * The preview area should maintain 4:3 aspect ratio no matter the screen size
    * The preview area should work with inconsistent image sizes (any width or height)
    * The preview area should provide spacing between the image and the bounding box of the card
    * Any images placed inside the preview area should maintain their own aspect ratio
    * Any image smaller than the dimensions of the preview area should maintain his maximum width and height. (Make sure you add at least one small image)
  * The design is meant to show an example of product grid with responsive images. You don't have to follow it, feel free to style, add or remove any extra elements
  * <Special /> Be creative with the background of the preview area. Feel free to experiment with colors and effects to make the space around the image and the image itself look good.
