  Participants have time to review the requirements and to prepare their code.

  #### 2. Contribution

  Participants submit their work to the project **at least 2 days** before the meeting by following the [contribution guide](/fe-hunger-games/contribution-guide/).

  #### 3. Code review

  Before the meeting everybody review the code every other participant submitted. He takes notes of one or two things which made strong impression to him and wants to discuss with the rest.

  During the meeting everybody shares his notes/topics and the group is discussing each one. If a person don't have  anything to share, somebody else takes his turn.
