      <h2>What is this?</h2>

      <p>This is a coding game for closed community focused on core front-end languages and native APIs, where the participants get a challenge every month to build a simple UI block by specified requirements. For example, basic form which uses native browser validation, article content with unique links, modal using native HTML elements and so on.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>All participants are building the same thing, compare and discuss the differences in their code and then vote, anonymously, which one is the best.</li>

        <li>There is a new UI challenge every month, for which the participants will submit their code</li>

        <li>There are a set of requirements for each challenge which describe the UI block which have to be built. These requirements could be in text form, design, image, something else or all together depending on the challenge.</li>

        <li>There is a special requirement for every challenge, which will be different every time - E.g. make it pixel perfect, use this specific new JS API, make it as creative as possible, make it accessibleâ€¦</li>
      </ul>
